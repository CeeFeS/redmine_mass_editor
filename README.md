# Redmine Mass Editor

The Redmine Mass Editor is a Django-based web application designed to facilitate batch editing of Redmine tickets. This tool is perfect for project managers and teams looking for an efficient way to manage and update multiple Redmine issues simultaneously. By leveraging the power of Python and Django, the Redmine Mass Editor simplifies the process of bulk modifications, making project management tasks more manageable and less time-consuming.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Field Selection:** Users can easily select multiple custom fields in Redmine tickets they wish to edit, streamlining the process of identifying which ticket attributes need updates.

- **Value Modification:** Once fields are selected, users can choose new values for these fields, enabling quick updates to ticket statuses, priorities, assignees, and more.

- **CSV Export and Import:** The application supports exporting the selected fields and their current values to a CSV file. Users can then edit this CSV offline in their preferred spreadsheet software. Once the edits are complete, the updated CSV can be re-imported into the Mass Editor.

- **Batch Update:** With the updated CSV uploaded, users can apply changes to multiple tickets at once with the click of a button, significantly reducing the time and effort required for ticket management.

- **Process Logging:** The application provides real-time feedback through a progress bar during the batch update process and displays a log of any errors or issues encountered, allowing users to easily troubleshoot and restart the process if necessary.
